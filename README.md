# Project Name

Brief project description.

## Game Idea
The central idea of the developed video game revolves around survival and evasion, through an intuitive yet challenging gameplay mechanic. The title is designed in a 2D format with a main character representing a king. This king has the ability to move across the screen and jump over obstacles that appear along the way. The objective of the game is to navigate through these obstacles and maintain the king's score for as long as possible.

## Game Proposal
The proposal for this game focuses on providing a gaming experience that challenges the player's skill and reflexes, while also encouraging continuous improvement and repetition. The player is faced with the challenge of keeping the main character, the king, alive by jumping over obstacles that appear in the path. Each obstacle is both a challenge and a learning opportunity. The game combines challenge, skill, reflexes, and a strong sense of repetition and improvement to offer an engaging and rewarding gaming experience.
